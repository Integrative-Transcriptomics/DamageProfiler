###### Method
DamageProfiler calculates damage profiles of mapped reads and provides a 
graphical as well as texted based representation. 

It creates 
- damage plot
- fragment length distribution
- identity distribution 
- base frequency table of reference 
- occurrences of different base misincorporations

A more detailed description and tutorial of DamageProfiler is coming soon.
