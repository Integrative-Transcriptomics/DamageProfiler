###### Method
DamageProfiler calculates damage profiles of mapped reads and provides a 
graphical as well as texted based representation. 

It creates 
- damage plots
- a fragment length distribution
- a read identity distribution 
- a base frequency table of reference 
- a table of different base misincorporations and their occurencies

Stay tuned, a more detailed description, manual and tutorial of DamageProfiler is coming soon.
